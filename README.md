# RU-CCN
Final assignment Computational Cognitive Neuroscience

##Requirements
Python 3.5

Tensorflow 0.11

Numpy

Scipy

##Usage
Only `train.py` and `test.py` can be run, the rest of the files are libraries.

##Optional
These steps are optional, without these datafiles the python program will just run if all the dependencies are installed. This just makes the progress faster, since you don't  have to download the data files from the Yahoo! Finance website. The downside of downloading all the stock data is that it is almost 8 GB when extracted.
The stock data files that are crawled and a pretrained model are available for download here: https://joshuavankleef.stackstorage.com/s/DUW3YooaIJ3zvCr .

`pickle.tar.gz` contains the stock data files. 

`experiments.tar.gz` contains the pretrained models.

The pretrained models need to be placed in `./experiments` and the stock data files in `../pickle`
